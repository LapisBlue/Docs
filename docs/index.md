Welcome to the Lapis documentation!

## About Lapis
As on our homepage:
> We're a group of Minecraft modders excited about the future of Sponge and Minecraft modding.

> We're building a variety of toolkits, mods, plugins, and libraries to discourage code duplication and encourage modularity and growth.

We use [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) to build our Java projects, 
and [Gulp + node](http://gulpjs.com/) to build our static website projects(homepage, docs).

All our work is free, open-source, and MIT-licensed.

## Projects

We're working on several projects!

__TODO:__ Add projects.

## Work with us

We'd love to have any help you wish to give!

We have several communication methods:

- File an issue in one of our [github repos](https://github.com/LapisBlue)
- Talk with us at `#lapis` on esper.net

__TODO:__ We'll soon post a [public styleguide and contributing guideline](/contributing).
