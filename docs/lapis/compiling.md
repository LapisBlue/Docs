title: 'Compiling'
---

## Java Projects
We use [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), use `./gradlew` build to compile the project.

## Static Sites
On our static sites (including the home page and docs page), we use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), a build system on [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
You do not have to worry about this when editing documentation, just edit one of the files in the docs directory. 
Your changes will be handled like any PR.
